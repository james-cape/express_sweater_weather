# Introduction
Based on Backend Mod 4 [project requirements](https://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/express_sweater_weather/express_sweater_weather_spec) set forth by [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).

## Welcome to Express Sweater Weather!
This project allows users to register, login, and retrieve a forecast for a location via API calls and responses.

#### Future Iterations
Future iterations of this project will include:
* Favoriting Locations
* Listing Favorite Locations
* Removing Favorite Locations


#### Learning Goals
* Utilize a project board to create and track details for project completion
* Practice written technical communication with concise and consistent git commits and clear pull requests
* Clearly document Introduction, Initial Setup, How to Use, Known Issues, Running Tests, How to Contribute, Core Contributors, Schema Design, and Tech Stack List
* Implement testing in JavaScript
* Familiarize self with mechanics of building an Express API

# Known Issues
#### Future iterations not yet completed:
* Favoriting Locations
* Listing Favorite Locations
* Removing Favorite Locations

#### Testing
Not all edge cases are tested or functional, such as checking whether an API key or email is unique.

# Running Tests (Using Jest)
```
$ npm test
```
